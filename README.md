### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is [Benny](http://bennycode.com/) (he/him) and you are probably using software to which I contributed (Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, Node.js, Electron, Prettier, ESLint). âœ¨

I enjoy working on open source software very much because it teaches me (and you) how to communicate, coordinate and cooperate with others. That's the spirit I like, live & share. Let's build great software together. ðŸ’ª

During the day, I work for [South Pole](https://www.southpole.com/) where we take climate action. In my spare time, [I answer questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/451634/) and [share my knowledge about TypeScript on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/typescripttv). ðŸŽ¬

Feel free to write me if you have questions about programming or want to work on exciting projects with me. I do maintain a library of [popular trading indicators](https://github.com/bennycode/trading-signals).

So long!

Benny
